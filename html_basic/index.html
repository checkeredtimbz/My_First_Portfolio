    <h1>Welcome to My Portfolio</h1>
    <h2>Learning Web Development</h2>
    <h3>This Is Just the Beginning</h3>

    <p>
      This webpage is my very first step into the world of front-end web development.
      I’m creating it from scratch using only HTML, without any fancy tools or frameworks.
      It may be simple, but it represents real progress in my ALX journey.
    </p>

    <p>
      The goal of this project is to master the basics—tags, structure, and semantics.
      I’ve learned how to use headings, paragraphs, and attributes to present content clearly.
      Understanding how the browser interprets this code is already opening my eyes.
    </p>

    <p>
      One cool thing about HTML is how it builds the foundation of every webpage online.
      From small blogs to massive platforms, it all begins here.
      Learning it gives me power to shape how information is displayed on the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is just the beginning of my tech career.
      I’m looking forward to building more complex pages and adding interactivity with CSS and JavaScript.
      For now, this basic portfolio is proof that I’ve taken the first meaningful step.
